Sure, there were levels where I died a few times, but no levels where I had to start seriously sweating to complete. There wasn't even a 'hard' difficulty to pick, unless you count the 1-hit death badge, which doesn't really count.\n\nHowever, apart from that, every other aspect of this game is absolutely amazing and I would strongly recommend this to anyone who grew up with 3D platformers like I did. It truly is a masterpiece of a game.\n\nTo add to this, I beat the Seal the Deal and Nyazuka Metro DLCs. I completed all of Death Wish! It was really hard, but very fulfilling; I felt like I did something not many other people can do. Generally, I loved Seal the Deal, but Nyazuka Metro felt a little lacking.

A common thing in games like this is things like unskippable cutscenes and putting the last save point ages away from the boss I'm fighting. When I'm fighting a boss, I much prefer restarting right before the boss instead of starting at a save point 30-60 seconds away from the boss. It doesn't feel challenging, it's just annoying. The challenge should be in the game itself, and should make me want to overcome the obstacles. Additionally, I felt the physics were a bit floaty; I'm more of a fan of rigid, robust controls. On the other hand, the music was good, the graphics were amazing and the story was decent.

To be honest, half way through I got a bit bored because it was literally just waiting for messages, and the in-game games, as cool as they were, got old quick. The ending was super cool, I liked how the room you were in was the elevator the whole time. I picked the option to leave the room, and I walked into Charlotte's bakery to read the message. All in all it's a neat game but I wouldn't play it again to get the other endings.","hidden":true,"link":""}},{"name":{"text":"Okami HD","hidden":false,"link":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%C5%8Ckami#High-definition_remaster"},"score":{"text":"8","hidden":false,"link":""},"platform":{"text":"PC","hidden":false,"link":""},"description":{"text":"I stopped playing the original on PS2, but I replayed it in HD, on Steam.

The ending was also really great, it felt fitting to the story. The only complaint would be the controls feel a bit slippery, especially when I'm doing platforming. Additionally, the first 10 hours were a bit slow, but after that, the game picks up momentum and draws you in more.

A remake of the fourth entry in the series. It's my first modern Ys game! First thing's first, the gameplay. I feel it's the best Ys has done so far (then again, I haven't played 7, 8 or Ark yet). It feels so good to shield\/dodge at just the right time and watch the game slow down! Plus, it's really dynamic and fast-paced. You can't jump, but I liked the skills and extra skills. All in all, I loved the gameplay; it was so refreshing and satisfying and I really hope the later modern Ys games are like that, if not better. I got the best weapon and armour in the game, fully upgraded, and I fully levelled my party, and it felt so amazing to run through enemies and kill everything in one hit! In terms of the party system, I didn't think much of it. I preferred it, gameplay wise, when it was just Adol. I felt I had more control. However, being in a party makes it less lonely! However, the AI isn't that great, so that feeling doesn't last long! The story is what I expected it to be; it's Ys, it keeps it simple yet good enough to make it interesting and make you want to keep playing. I do admit though, the ending felt too quick, but at least it was canonical (Adol never logged anything past the ending of the game in his books). I did like the bit at the end where Adol was the only one left to throw the mask into the volcano, although I felt Falcom could've made that ending segment a bit more dramatic. Fighting a phantom version of Gruda was cool, because his moveset felt very similar to mine, almost as if I was fighting myself, but what would've been more awesome would've been a three-phase boss of actual Gruda, who escaped Iris and wants to put Adol through one final test, with an intense rock remix of the main intro theme of the game! Speaking of music, I felt it was the worst part of this Ys entry. I often missed the intense, awesome rock music that you get from other titles like Origin or Oath. There were some, but often it felt a little generic. I love the intro song though; that's the best song for me! To be honest, speaking generally in terms of Ys, I would like it more if there was some kind of motif for the entire Ys series that played in every game, similar to Zelda. The controls were good. The best controls are when you don't think about it when you use them. It's nothing amazing, but they didn't screw it up either. The graphics were also decent. For a PSP Vita game brought to PC, it was pretty good. I prefer this art style to the previous art styles that Ys adopted; it feels more \"anime\". All in all, I'm really liking modern Ys! I can definitely see the differences between modern and classic. If I had to pick one, I'd say modern, although they both have their pros and cons.","hidden":true,"link":""}}],"name":"Finished Games","description":"These are a list of games I've finished.

entry to the JoJo series, but I felt it was the weakest one. There were some stands that just felt stupid, and some battles that felt too ass-pully. Although, there were some cool bits, like Hermes' stand Kiss, and the Marilyn Manson arc had really good tension! Unfortunately, I was spoiled for the ending for Part 6, so I didn't get the full experience at the end. All in all, I'm glad I read it, but the other parts were better.","hidden":true,"link":""}},{"name":{"text":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 7: Steel Ball Run","hidden":false,"link":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/1706\/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_Part_7__Steel_Ball_Run"},"score":{"text":"7","hidden":false,"link":""},"description":{"text":"Steel Ball Run was pretty good! It got a little confusing around the end, though. However, the stands were a lot better than Stone Ocean, as they actually made sense most of the time and weren't too \"bizarre\".\n\nMy favourite stand has to be Tusk Act 3; I love the concept of being able to move your body parts around anywhere you want, through holes you can move around the ground!\n\nHowever, I didn't like the concept of spin. It felt too convenient and I couldn't grasp the boundaries of the power. It was like Hamon; it just worked.\n\nOn the other hand, I loved the way Steel Ball Run made itself bizarre, for example Diego's stand turning him into a dinosaur. It makes perfect sense, and it's a cool stand that's not too weird (like the stands in Part 6), but it's also really wacky and would make no sense out of context! If JoJo had more things like that, I would appreciate the series a lot more.\n\nAdditionally, I loved the sub-villain Ringo Roadagain. His stand was so simple, yet it was applied so well. \n\nAll in all, Part 4 is still my most favourite part, but Steel Ball Run was definitely enjoyable and did have its great bits.","hidden":true,"link":""}}]},{"name":"Dropped Manga","description":"These are manga I've started reading, but then quitted.","items":[]},{"name":"Plan To Read","description":"These are manga I wish to read sometime in the future.","items":[{"name":{"text":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 8: JoJolion","hidden":false,"link":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/25515\/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken_Part_8__JoJolion"},"score":{"text":"0","hidden":false,"link":""},"description":{"text":"The next part of the JoJo series!
